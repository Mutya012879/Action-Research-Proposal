Parent involvement in education is a critical aspect of a student's academic success, and this is particularly true. Parent involvement refers to the active participation of parents in their child's education, including their academic performance, behavior, and well-being. In this context, parent involvement can be an essential tool to enhance the academic performance in science of Grade 8 Science Class students in Bangbang National High School.
Researchers, policymakers, and educators have recognized the importance of parent involvement in education. Studies have shown that parental involvement in education is associated with higher student academic achievement, increased motivation, improved behavior, and better social skills. Furthermore, parent involvement can positively affect a student's self-esteem and can foster a positive attitude toward learning.
Enhancing parent involvement in education can be a powerful tool to improve the academic performance of students. Schools and teachers can facilitate and encourage parent involvement in communication, homework support, curriculum involvement, encouragement and motivation, and collaborative learning. By promoting parent involvement in these areas, schools can foster a positive learning environment and support students' academic success. 

The research study is to investigate the extent of parent involvement in enhancing the academic performance in science of Grade 8 Science Class students from Bangbang National High Scool, and to identify effective strategies to promote parent involvement in education. 
The findings of this research study on parent involvement in enhancing the academic performance in science of Grade 8 students from Bangbang National High School is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it aims to contribute to the existing body of literature on the role of parent involvement in education, particularly in the context of science education in the Philippines. By exploring the extent of parent involvement and identifying effective strategies for promoting parent involvement, this study seeks to provide valuable insights for educators and policymakers on how to improve student academic achievement.
Secondly, this study is significant because it addresses a specific problem in Bangbang National High School, where there may be a lack of awareness or understanding among parents and educators of the specific ways in which parent involvement can positively impact a student's academic performance. By identifying, the factors that contribute to or hinder parent involvement and exploring effective strategies for promoting parent involvement, this study can inform the development of policies and practices that will improve the academic performance in science of  Grade 8 Science Class  students from Bangbang National High School.
Thirdly, this research study is significant because it focuses specifically on science education, which is an important area of study for the Philippines as it aims to develop a science-literate population that can contribute to the country's economic development. By identifying effective strategies for promoting parent involvement in science education, this study can contribute to the goal of developing a science-literate population in the Division of Marinduque and the Philippines as a whole.
